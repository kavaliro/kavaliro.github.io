I recently bought Tsuro of the Seas. Tsuro of the Seas is a beautiful board game where you place tiles to create and follow a maze of paths with your ship. (As near as I can tell, "tsuro" translates to "path" or "way.") Meanwhile, there are [daikaiju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiju), specifically dragons, who are scattered around the seas which may wake up looking for food--that is, your ship. If you're the last ship standing, you win.

Tsuro plays fast, and doesn't require a serious mental commitment. Game turns are simple. There is a very even mix of strategy and luck, although the strategy doesn't get too deep. Tsuro makes a fast, easy filler game that allows table conversation to continue smoothly.
