I've started a project to get the Baha'i Writings translated into Esperanto. It starts with gathering all of the existing digital translations into one spot and cataloguing them, and putting them in a consistent future-proof format. Since this is a GitHub project, it makes terrific sense to use Markdown for simple documents and AsciiDoc for complex documents. Once that's complete, we (hopefully there will be a "we" involved) can create tickets for all the outstanding documents, and begin translating. I think Git and GitHub are perfect for this kind of project; the tools are as simple as one could possibly hope for, and yet powerful and appropriate enough to make the job easy.
